	I will admit, this is an older portfolio, but I wanted to update a few things on it to reflect my current self.
	And honestly, if I had to do this all over again, I probably would have done the exact same thing.
	I really like the design of this.

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My journey through development began when I was 14 years old, creating short programs in Lua for a game engine called LOVE, or Love2D. Since then I've been creating programs, games, apps, and plugins for various platforms, and I have installed, set up, hosted, and maintained several websites in my past 10 years of software development, including using databases such as SQLite and MySQL, CMS services like Wordpress and Ghost, and query-based web languages like jQuery, PHP, and Handlebars.</p>
                    <p>One of my favorite activities is group coding. Whether it's side-by-side on location, or day-by-day remotely, having others to work with is a great pleasure and even a great review. I've worked with several other seasoned programmers on projects such as video games, software addons, and program optimizations.</p>
                    <p>Surprisingly, coding isn't my only passion. I also enjoy creating music, editing videos, broadcasting games, and watching late-night Netflix with my roommate. Some of them I end up doing on the same project! The creative world of art never ceases to captivate my attention and wonder.</p>
